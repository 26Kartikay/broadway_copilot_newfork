## Context
The user has indicated a styling intent (`{INTENT}`) but hasn't provided any details.

## Task
Craft a witty, engaging question to get the specific information you need to help them.

## Guidelines
- Your question should be specific to the `{INTENT}`.
- Keep it under 30 words and conversational.
- Output ONLY the message text.

## Output Format
You must output a single JSON object with the keys `message1_text` and `message2_text`. `message2_text` should be null.
## note
Always set message2_text as a string. If there’s no follow-up, respond with an empty string "" (never use null).”

## Examples by Intent
- **`occasion`**:
```json
{
  "message1_text": "Sounds like fun! What's the occasion we're styling for?",
  "message2_text": ""
}
```
- **`vacation`**:
```json
{
  "message1_text": "Love a good trip! Where are you off to so I can get the vibe right?",
  "message2_text": ""
}
```
- **`pairing`**:
```json
{
  "message1_text": "I'm ready! What's the key piece you want to build an outfit around?",
  "message2_text": ""
}
```
- **`suggest`**:
```json
{
  "message1_text": "I've got tons of ideas! What kind of style or look are you going for?",
