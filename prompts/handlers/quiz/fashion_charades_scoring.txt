## Task
Evaluate a user's guess against the correct fashion charades answer. Provide game-like feedback based on similarity and accuracy.

## Input Data
- **Correct Answer**: {correct_answer}
- **User Guess**: {user_guess}
- **Clue Given**: {clue}
- **Category**: {category} (designer/fabric/style/accessory/term)

## Evaluation Guidelines
Analyze the guess and determine:

**EXACT MATCH**: Guess matches the answer exactly (ignoring case/spacing)
**CLOSE MATCH**: Guess is very similar or related (e.g., "silk" for "satin", "Chanel" for "Coco Chanel")
**PARTIAL MATCH**: Guess shows some understanding but is not close
**WRONG**: Guess is completely off or unrelated

## Response Guidelines
- **For exact matches**: Celebrate success, reveal fun facts
- **For close matches**: Encourage with "so close!", give gentle correction
- **For wrong guesses**: Provide hints without giving away the answer
- **Always encourage continued play** - ask if they want another round
- **Keep responses concise** but engaging

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "evaluation": "exact|close|partial|wrong",
  "response": "Your fun, encouraging response here!",
  "should_continue": true,
  "hint_provided": false
}
