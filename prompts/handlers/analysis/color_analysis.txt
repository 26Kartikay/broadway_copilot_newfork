## 🎨✨ Task: Seasonal Color Palette Identification

Your task is to analyze the user's uploaded image and determine their seasonal color palette.

---

### 🪞 Step 1: Quality Check  
If the image is too dark, blurry, or not showing a face clearly — set `quality_ok` to `false` and provide a friendly message asking for a clearer photo.  
Be gentle and polite, e.g.: "Oops, can you try sending a clearer picture of your face? 💖"

### 🎨 Step 2: Seasonal Palette Analysis  
From a valid image, analyze the user's:
- **Skin tone** (warm, cool, or neutral undertones)
- **Eye color** (brightness, depth, warmth/coolness)
- **Hair color** (warmth, depth, contrast)
- **Overall contrast level** (low, medium, high)
- **Inferred Gender** (MALE, FEMALE, or UNKNOWN if unable to confidently determine)

Based on these characteristics, determine which of the 12 seasonal palettes best matches the user:

**Spring Palettes:**
- `LIGHT_SPRING` - Light, warm, clear coloring with golden undertones
- `WARM_SPRING` - Warm, golden, peachy coloring with medium contrast
- `CLEAR_SPRING` - Bright, clear, warm coloring with high contrast

**Summer Palettes:**
- `LIGHT_SUMMER` - Light, cool, soft coloring with low contrast
- `COOL_SUMMER` - Cool, blue/pink undertones with medium contrast
- `SOFT_SUMMER` - Soft, muted, cool-to-neutral coloring with low contrast

**Autumn Palettes:**
- `SOFT_AUTUMN` - Soft, warm, muted coloring with low contrast
- `WARM_AUTUMN` - Warm, golden, rich coloring with medium contrast
- `DEEP_AUTUMN` - Deep, warm, rich coloring with high contrast

**Winter Palettes:**
- `COOL_WINTER` - Cool, deep coloring with high contrast
- `CLEAR_WINTER` - Clear, bright, cool coloring with high contrast
- `DEEP_WINTER` - Deep, cool coloring with very high contrast

### 💌 Output Format (Structured JSON)
Return your result as a **single JSON object** (no text outside JSON):

```json
{
  "quality_ok": true,
  "palette_name": "WARM_AUTUMN",
  "error_message": null,
  "inferred_gender": "FEMALE"
}
```

If the image quality is poor:
```json
{
  "quality_ok": false,
  "palette_name": null,
  "error_message": "Oops, can you try sending a clearer picture of your face? 💖",
  "inferred_gender": null
}
```

**Important:** 
- `palette_name` must be EXACTLY one of the 12 palette values listed above (e.g., `WARM_AUTUMN`, `LIGHT_SPRING`, etc.)
- Use uppercase with underscores (e.g., `LIGHT_SPRING`, not `Light Spring`)
- If quality is not ok, set `palette_name` to `null`, `inferred_gender` to `null`, and provide `error_message`
