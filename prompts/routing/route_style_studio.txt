Available sub-intents:

- style_studio_occasion: Styling for specific occasions like weddings or parties.
- style_studio_vacation: Styling advice for travel and vacation packing.
- style_studio_general: General styling recommendations and outfits.

Output ONLY the JSON object with key "subIntent" and no extra text.

}

Output:
{
